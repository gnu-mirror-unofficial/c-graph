<!-- This is the template document for GNU web pages.  We use
     server side includes (#include) for common elements, for
     instance, the very first line of the file.  If you're reading
     this in its expanded form, you can retrieve the original source,

<!-- Instructions for adapting this boilerplate to a new project: -->

<!-- 1. In the line above starting "Parent-Version:", remove the
        "$Revision...$" from around the revision number,
        leaving just Parent-Version: and the number. -->

<!-- 2. Replace "baz" with the name of your project.
        You should be able to do this with search and replace;
        making sure that the search is case insensitive and
        that the case of the replacement matches the case
        of the string found. In Emacs, query-replace will do this
        when case-fold-search and case-replace are both non-nil
        and both search and replacement string are given in lower case. -->

<!-- 3. Of course update the actual information according to your project,
        such as mailing lists, project locations, and maintainer name.  -->

<!-- 4. You can use the patch-from-parent script to semi-automate
        merging future changes to the boilerplate with your file:
        http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/patch-from-parent?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain

<h3>About C-Graph </h3>

<p>GNU C-Graph demonstrates the theory of convolution underlying
  engineering systems and signal analysis. "C-Graph" is an abbreviation
  for "Convolution Graph".</p>

<p>Unlike other signal processing packages, C-Graph dispenses with the
 learning curve for writing code. Instead, an interactive dialogue
 guides the user to effortlessly select values for keyboard input.</p>

<p>C-Graph offers an array of scalable pulses, periodic, and aperiodic
  signal types fundamental to the study of systems theory. The package
  displays the spectra of any two waveforms chosen by the user, computes
  their linear convolution, then compares their circular convolution
  according to the convolution theorem. Each signal is modelled by a
  register of N discrete values (samples), and the discrete Fourier
  Transform (DFT) computed by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).</p>

<p>Students of signal and systems theory will find GNU C-Graph to be of
  value.</p>

a mirror</a> if possible.</p>


<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p><a href="manual/">Documentation for
C-Graph</a>
is available online, as
is <a href="/manual/">documentation for most GNU software</a>.  You may
also find more information about
C-Graph
by running
<em>info&nbsp;c-graph</em>
or by looking at
<em>/usr/doc/c-graph/</em>,
<em>/usr/local/doc/c-graph/</em>,
or similar directories on your system.  A brief summary is available by
running <em>c-graph&nbsp;--help</em>.</p>


<h3 id="mail">Mailing lists</h3>

<p>The mailing list for C-Graph is:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-c-graph">bug-c-graph</a>
is used to discuss most aspects of C-Graph, including development and
enhancement requests, as well as bug reports. This list is also for
general user help and discussion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Announcements about
C-Graph
and most other GNU software are made on
<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-gnu">info-gnu</a>
(<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/">archive</a>).</p>


<h3 id="contribute">Getting involved</h3>

<p>As with all GNU packages, development of C-Graph is a volunteer
  effort. To contribute, join the mailing list (see above) and
  read <a href="/help/">How to help GNU</a>. </p>

<h3>Origin </h3>

<p>GNU C-Graph is derived from the BSc. Honours dissertation in
  Electrical Engineering "Interactive Computer Package Demonstrating:
  Sampling Convolution and the FFT", Adrienne Gaye Thompson, University
  of Aberdeen (1983).</p>

<p>Adrienne - who is sole author of the dissertation - reproduced its
  Fortran 77 program in modern Fortran. She donated C-Graph to GNU
  realising that the package's usefulness could be enjoyed globally.</p>


<h3>Dedication </h3> 

<p>C-Graph is dedicated to all victims of apartheid, and to
 Haitian-Bahamian attorney-at-law and human rights advocate, Eliezer
 Regnier.</p>
